# Overview

The Diffusion Equation software is developed as a tool for research, education and commercial use.

The documentation is organised in sections for easy understanding of the code structure and for easy access to all information, functions, parameters and properties.

Currently, all the data and results can be accessed through different variable results from the Integrated Developed Environment (IDE) of your choice and trhough graphical representation.

The software can be accessed on a public repository hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/Building-acoustics-TU-Eindhoven/Diffusion) and is situated within the TU/e Building Acoustics organization. Within the repository, a preliminary version of the documentation for the software has been provided for users. The documentation includes information regarding the libraries needed to run the code as well as an explanatory section discussing the numerical method used for creating the software. The documentations are included in the READ-me.md file of this GitHub repository.
