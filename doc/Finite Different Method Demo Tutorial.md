# Finite Different Method Demo Tutorial

Test the software with the following inputs (Navarro et al., 2012):

- Spatial discretization: $\Delta x = 0.5 m$;
- Time discretization: $\Delta t = 1/8000 s$;
- Recording total time: $T = 2.0 s$;
- Room dimension: 8.0 m x 8.0 m x 8.0 m;
- Absorption Coefficient surface i: 1/6 ≈ 0.17;
- Air absorption: 0.0 1/m;
- Absorption term: A_{M};
- Source position coordinates: 4.0 m, 4.0 m, 4.0 m;
- Receiver position coordinates: 2.0 m, 2.0 m, 2.0 m;

Test if the software provides the following results (Navarro et al., 2012):

- Reverberation time (RT): 1.18 s; 
- Early Decay Time (EDT): 1.18 s;
- Clarity ($C_{80}$): 2.08 dB;
- Definition ($D_{50}$): 45.63 %
- Centre Time ($T_{s}$): 85.33 ms

The result file is a pickle file called resultsFDM.pkl. All the results are included in this file.
